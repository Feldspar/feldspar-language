-- | A module for /virtual vectors/. Many of the functions defined here are
-- imitations of Haskell's list operations, and to a first approximation they
-- behave accordingly.
--
-- A virtual vector is normally guaranteed not to be present in the generated
-- code. The only exceptions are:
--
--   * when it is explicitly forced using the functions 'force' or 'desugar'
--
--   * when it is the input or output of a program
--
--   * when it is accessed by a function outside the "Feldspar.Vector" API, for
--     example, 'condition' or 'forLoop'
--
-- Note also that most operations only introduce a small constant overhead on
-- the vector. The exceptions are
--
--   * 'fold'
--
--   * 'fold1'
--
--   * Functions that introduce storage (see above)
--
--   * \"Folding\" functions: 'sum', 'maximum', etc.
--
-- These functions introduce overhead that is linear in the length of the
-- vector.
