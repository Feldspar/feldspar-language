The files in src/Onnx and its subdirectories are generated from the ONNX
protobuf specification file 'onnx.proto' located in src/Feldspar/Onnx using
the command 'hprotoc Feldspar/Onnx/onnx.proto' given from the src directory.
The generated file src/Onnx.hs is not committed.

The 'hprotoc' command comes from the 'hprotoc-2.4.13' package on Hackage.
