The files in src/Onnx and its subdirectories are generated from the ONNX
protobuf specification file 'onnx.proto' located in src/Feldspar/Onnx using
the command 'hprotoc Feldspar/Onnx/onnx.proto' given from the src directory.
The 'hprotoc' command comes from the 'protocol-buffers-2.4.12' package on Hackage.
