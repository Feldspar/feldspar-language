The files in src/Onnx/Onnx and its subdirectories are generated from the
ONNX protobuf specification file 'onnx.proto' located in src/Onnx using
the command 'hprotoc onnx.proto' given from the src/Onnx directory.
The generated file src/Onnx/Onnx.hs is not committed.

The 'hprotoc' command comes from the 'hprotoc-2.4.13' package on Hackage.
